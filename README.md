# LALE - Linking and Loading Executables

Not much to see here. Intended for pedagogy rather than performing a particular function.

Planning to study linking and loading of PE and ELF. Might add Mac eventually.

## **Brainstorm** of things to do ⛈️
* Linker Project from [Linkers & Loaders](https://linker.iecc.com/) 🏗️
* Implement `execve`
* Userspace loader for malware
    - I think [Learning Linux Binary Analysis](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-Linux-Binary-Analysis) may have shown something like that
* Something like `readelf` that also recognizes Windows and Mac formats
* Devise my own heuristic executable format
* Typed notes on both theory and implementation 🚧
* Annotated Bibliography of books and articles on linkers & loaders

## Miscellaneous
* [libbfd](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/bfd-2.9.1/html_chapter/bfd_1.html) is likely the "right" way to work with object code, but I'm still learning and don't want to abstract away the details
